helm-bibtex
===========

A helm source for searching entries in a BibTeX bibliography.

## Key features:

- Quick access to your bibliography from within Emacs
- Provides instant search results as you type
- Support for multiple BibTeX files
- Insert BibTeX key of selected entry in your current document
- Open the PDF associated with an entry
- Add notes to an entry
- Edit selected entry
- Quick access to online bibliographic databases such as Pubmed,
  arXiv, Google Scholar, Library of Congress, etc.

Here is a screenshot showing a search for entries containing the word *reading*:

At the bottom of the list are dummy entries that can be used to search online databases.  The following databases are preconfigured:

- Google Scholar
- arXiv
- Pubmed
- Bodleian Library
- Library of Congress
- Deutsche Nationalbibliothek
- British National Library
- Bibliothèque National de France
- Gallica Bibliothèque Numérique

This list can be extended using the customization variable `helm-bibtex-fallback-options`.

## Requirements

In order to run helm-bibtex, a number of packages have to be installed on your system.  The easiest way to get these packages is through [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/).

- [Helm](http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/helm): incremental search framework (helm-bibtex is a plug-in for Helm)
- [Ebib](http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/ebib): a BibTeX database manager for Emacs
- [dash](http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/dash): a powerful list-processing library
- [s](http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/s): the long lost Emacs string manipulation library.
- [f](http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/f): a modern API for working with files and directories

## Installation

Helm-bibtex can be installed via [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net/#/helm-bibtex).  Alternatively, put the file `helm-bibtex.el` in a directory included in your load-path.  Add the following line to your start-up file (typically init.el):

    (autoload 'helm-bibtex "helm-bibtex" "" t)

Tell helm-bibtex where your BibTeX file is by setting the customization variable `helm-bibtex-bibliography`.

    (setq helm-bibtex-bibliography "/path/to/bibtex-file.bib")

Alternatively, you can specify a list of BibTeX files.

    (setq helm-bibtex-bibliography '("/path/to/bibtex-file-1.bib" "/path/to/bibtex-file-2.bib"))

Other customization variables are:

- `helm-bibtex-library-path`: Location where PDFs of the entries are stored
- `helm-bibtex-pdf-open-function`: Function used for opening PDFs (the default function opens them in Emacs)
- `helm-bibtex-format-insert-key-function`: Function used for formatting bibtex key when inserting (the default function returnes the key itself). Note that the function should accept a list of keys as input, with multiple marked entries one can insert multiple keys at once, e.g. \cite{key1,key2}.
- `helm-bibtex-notes-path`: Location where notes are stored (one file per entry)
- `helm-bibtex-notes-extension`: File extension of the files containing the notes
- `helm-bibtex-fallback-options`: Online databases for which dummy entries are provided
- `helm-bibtex-browser-function`: The browser that is used to access online databases

Helm-bibtex assumes that PDFs and notes have the BibTeX key of their associated entries as their base names plus ".pdf" for PDFs and whatever extension is configured for notes (".org" by default).

## Usage

The command `helm-bibtex` starts a new search.  It is recommended to bind it to a convenient key for quick access.  For filtering the following fields are used: author, title, year, and entry-type.  Regular expressions can be used as search terms.  Example searches:

Everything ever published by Janet Fodor:

    janet fodor

All PhD theses:

    phdthesis

Lyn Frazier's PhD thesis:

    phdthesis frazier

Publications about eyetracking (regular expression used to match various spellings: *eyetracking*, *eye tracking*, *eye-tracking*):

    eye.?tracking

There are several actions for matching BibTeX entries:

- Open the PDF file associated with an entry if available (default).
- Insert BibTeX key at point.
- Edit notes associated with an entry.
- Show the entry in the BibTeX file.

To execute an action, select an entry and press `TAB` to see the list of available actions.
